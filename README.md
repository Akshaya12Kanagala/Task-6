### Step 1 : Creating Passwords
We start with a very simple password and gradually improve it by adding complexity.<br>
Password Example	   <br>               
`password123`     <t>   -    Common word + numbers (weak, dictionary vulnerable)  <br>
`Password123!`	     -    Added uppercase + symbol (better but still predictable) <br>
`Pa$$w0rd2025!`      -	  Substituted letters with symbols, added year (medium strength) <br>
`!QwErTy2025#`	     -    Random case + numbers + symbol (stronger, less predictable) <br>
`9$TgH@1!pLk#2025Zz` -    Long, random mix of all character types (very strong) <br>
