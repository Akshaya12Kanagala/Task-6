### Step 1 : Creating Passwords
We start with a very simple password and gradually improve it by adding complexity.<br>
Password Example	                  
`password123`            Common word + numbers (weak, dictionary vulnerable)
`Password123!`	         Added uppercase + symbol (better but still predictable)
`Pa$$w0rd2025!`     	   Substituted letters with symbols, added year (medium strength)
`!QwErTy2025#`	         Random case + numbers + symbol (stronger, less predictable)
`9$TgH@1!pLk#2025Zz`	   Long, random mix of all character types (very strong)
